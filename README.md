To get started type in a name and choose a color.
In the next screen you can either join an existing group or create a new group.
Within a group, annotations you will make and some of your settings will be shared to other group participants.
They will be automatically removed when you leave the group.

## Dashboards

There are three different dashboards available.
You will start with the master-timeline dashboard.
With the plus-button on the bottom you can add new timelines (either streamgraphs or episode plots).
Rearrange the timelines with the icon on the left.
The streamgraphs can be further adjusted with the settings button.
Add an annotation to a timeline by double-clicking it at a specific position.

Your groups annotations will be collected in the annotation-dashboard.
You can reach this by pressing the third button of the centered buttons in the header.
Here you are able to delete your own annotations only.

The investigator-dashboard can be opened by pressing the leftmost of the centered buttons in the header.
You may select a different timeline on top.
There should be a brush visible. If not make sure you have a non-white and opaque color by pressing the user-icon on the right in the header.
With the brush you adjust the visible data on the remaining dashboard.
Below the timeline are the episode plots for various categories.
The left side of the dashboard shows two maps for the Rumble data and the Radiation data.
